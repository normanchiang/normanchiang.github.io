This image was taken from a series of photographs done in Le Havre, France with a ballerina from the Paris Opera Ballet. JR brought dancers there this summer during the continuation of his Women Are Heroes project when he pasted a woman’s eyes onto a large container ship. The containers created a unique and inspiring atmosphere that JR enjoyed exploring.</p>
